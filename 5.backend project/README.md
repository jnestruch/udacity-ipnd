# Logs Analysis Project

Build a reporting tool (in plain text) to answer different questions based on information stored on a database. The tool will be a Python program using the `psycopg2` module to connect to the database.

### Coding practices

In order to pass the test, some guidelines needs to be followed. These are:

- Each question can be answered with a single database query 
- The code written should follow the PEP8 style guide
- In case Views are used, the code used to create them should be included here
