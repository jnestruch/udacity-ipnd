		<br><h3>Inline vs Block Elements</h3>
		Inline elements work in a linear way aplying the tags as the text appears. <br>On the other hand, block elements create like a box where everything fits in there and can be measurables in height and width.
		<p>Examples of inline elements are <b>br</b> or <b>span</b></p>
		<p>Examples of block elements are <b>p</b> or <b>div</b></p>
